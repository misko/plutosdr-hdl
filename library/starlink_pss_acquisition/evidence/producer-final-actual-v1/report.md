# Producer-local final product fence: actual functional result

**PASS within the frozen functional observation contract; no physical or release
claim.** Exactly one vendor simulation was run. Original owner handle 50316
exited 0, with persisted process/integrity/IP/independent-receipt statuses all
nonempty `0\n`. No retry, RTL edit, source relaxation, or new physical run.

## New real-controller sampled fence receipt

| Counter | Actual |
| --- | ---: |
| Pre / post checks | 623,129 / 623,129 |
| Sampled final / authorized / closed input | 140 / 140 / 140 |
| Sampled veto / unknown / malformed final | **0 / 0 / 0** |
| Nonsampled private authorization differences | 3 |
| Reset samples / inverse-owned read samples | 4,011 / 38,950 |
| Owned stalls / current fault edges | 5,458 / 7,882 |
| Private core-reset samples | 164,648 |
| Public ready/valid overlaps | 63 |

The 140 actual sampled final-write authorizations exactly match the old full
predicate; all require the checked completed-input/forward-phase/internal-bank
ownership invariant. The old request-toggle recurrence matches each checked
edge. All old public state, reasons, and numerical observations remain exact.

The three private differences were **not** sampled by publication. This monitor
counts them but does not emit individual cause/timestamp rows; do not attribute
their detailed causes solely from the separate fixture. Public overlap63 counts
the unchanged deliberately forced ready/valid aliases. It never masks sampled
authorization, internal ownership, or the original complete reference check.

The zero sampled-fault counts are important: unchanged actual faults often stop
tokens upstream before the mailbox final branch. This actual run does **not**
replace the separate real-guard/mailbox missing-veto, sticky-only, malformed-final,
and X/Z fast witnesses. Reset counts are samples, not independent reset events.
The separately found paused-slow reset gap remains unqualified and unchanged.

## Unchanged historical numerical and fault gates

Both main CSVs: 589,950 lines, 35,655,334 bytes, SHA256
`25ab9d06ca0e03f280540cda625a7826b3c4cbaa6322ce3266c59e1fbad94122`.
Both extra CSVs: 33,180 lines, 2,055,036 bytes, SHA256
`b965d12603a64111fa9c6ea36cb0f12189945ad4d9be7cf4fbd883980c4ec4a0`.
All four are complete, newline-closed, and match the historical full bytes.

Qualified-status scope: **1,246,258 = 953,795 raw-equal + 292,463 invalid-only**.
Every invalid-only row is retained with both status-valid bits exactly zero.
This is **not raw217 PASS**. All other 216 original fields, including all 27
product mailbox/wrapper constituents and all detailed reasons, remain
unconditional. The reference is still independently driven dec20 R1/D0/S0.

The old exact-control receipt reports active780,367, consumed36,
scratch-private-differences270, final-fault-edges2, owned-stalls99,936, and
reset-owned143. Both independent extra suites report exactly two final faults,
three held-final stalls, two one-sided resets, and four healthy recoveries.
Old CDC receipt: 712,146 checks. Old unconditional ROM shadow: 623,129 pre/post,
74,440 accepts, first148, last141, stalls11, reset4,011, current7,882, final115.
All old terminal marker, numerical, latency, fault, ownership, ROM, CDC, and new
sampled-final receipt validators pass; independent frozen verification was
repeated from `/` with original handle18197 exiting0.

## Preservation and remaining gate

Portable evidence is
`hdl/library/starlink_pss_acquisition/evidence/producer-final-actual-v1/`.
The package preserves full sources, owner and simulation logs, all four full
CSVs, after-only generated IP, WDB (lossless gzip parts at most40MiB each), exact
raw identities, and fresh read-only verification. Original project, temporary
files, source bundle, and old failed experiments remain intact locally.

This is independent of the inverse sealed-bank adapter. No source union,
production promotion, receiver build, radio work, synthesis, or route follows
automatically from the result. The prior measured K1/M1 physical result remains
negative; any future physical preparation needs separate source-specific review.
